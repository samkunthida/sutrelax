# Behind the SUT Relax Application
This is the **SUT Relax Mobile Application**, a university project designed to help individuals assess their mental health and ease their stress.
I was responsible for UX/UI designing, developing the application, implementing APIs, and managing the database, all within a three-month timeframe.
Although it may not be groundbreaking, I am so proud to have had the chance to contribute to this meaningful project.
